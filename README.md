# Skin-Cancer-Identification-Using-CNN-Based-Transfer-Learning
Skin cancer is a major public health concern, with incidence rates growing globally. The early and correct detection of skin cancer lesions is critical for improving patient outcomes and lowering mortality rates. We present a skin cancer identification system based on convolutional neural network (CNN).
